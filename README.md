# Welcome to My GitHub!

## About Me
Hi! I'm Jaemin Song, a graduate student in Industrial and Systems Engineering at Texas A&M University. I have a background in Industrial Engineering and a strong interest in applying data science to real-world problems — especially those at the intersection of biomedical systems and engineering analytics.

Currently, I’m part of the [Hoyt Lab](https://hoytlab.engr.tamu.edu/research-2/), where I work on biomedical data analysis, particularly involving high-frequency ultrasound signal data. My goal is to apply industrial engineering methodologies and machine learning to biomedical datasets to uncover patterns, support diagnosis, and improve healthcare decision-making.

Before grad school, I was involved in a range of academic projects, from classification of laryngeal diseases using vocal signals to hyperspectral image analysis for material detection.
