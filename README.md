# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub!

## About Me
Hi! I'm **Jaemin Song**, a graduate student in **Industrial and Systems Engineering** at **Texas A&M University**. I have a background in **Industrial Engineering** and a strong interest in applying data science to real-world problems — especially those at the intersection of **biomedical systems** and **engineering analytics**.

📊 Currently, I’m part of the [**Hoyt Lab**](https://hoytlab.engr.tamu.edu/research-2/), where I work on biomedical data analysis, particularly involving high-frequency ultrasound signal data. My goal is to apply industrial engineering methodologies and machine learning to biomedical datasets to uncover patterns, support diagnosis, and improve healthcare decision-making.

Before grad school, I was involved in a range of academic projects, from classification of laryngeal diseases using vocal signals to hyperspectral image analysis for material detection.
